# 📱 iOS Photo App

This project is an iOS application built using **MVVM**, **Moya**, and **UIKit**.  
It demonstrates how to fetch user data from an API, display a random user's albums, show album images, and provide advanced photo browsing features.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ **MVVM Architecture** for clean separation of concerns.  
- ✅ **Moya** for networking and API requests.
- ✅ **Combine** for binding data .  
- ✅ **UIKit** for UI components (UITableView & UICollectionView).  
- ✅ **Kingfisher** to load images efficiently with caching & placeholders.  
- ✅ **SKPhotoBrowser** for full-screen image viewing with zoom and **share support**.  
- ✅ **IQKeyboardManager** to handle keyboard behavior seamlessly.  
- ✅ **Search bar** to filter images by title.

## 🛠️ Flow
1. Fetch users from API.  
2. Pick one **random user**.  
3. Display this user’s **albums** in a `UITableView`.  
4. On selecting an album → display its **images** in a `UICollectionView`.  
5. Load images with **Kingfisher** (with placeholders).  
6. Tap an image → open in **SKPhotoBrowser** with zoom & share options.  
7. Use **search bar** to filter images by title.
